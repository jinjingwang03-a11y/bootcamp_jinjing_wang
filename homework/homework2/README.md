# Budget Lens - Homework 2

## Project Purpose

Budget Lens is a lightweight personal finance tracker designed to give individuals clear visibility into their spending habits. Unlike standard banking apps that only show balances, Budget Lens organizes transactions into intuitive categories and generates simple weekly summaries with charts and tables. By making spending patterns easy to understand, the tool empowers users to identify unnecessary expenses, adjust their behavior quickly, and make smarter decisions about saving and budgeting.
