# Stakeholder Memo: Budget Lens

## Why This Matters
Young people today often struggle with budgeting because banking apps only show balances — not where money actually goes. Without visibility into categories and trends, it's hard to cut unnecessary spending or build savings habits.  

**Budget Lens** provides that missing visibility. It is a simple, personal finance tracker that organizes expenses into categories and produces **weekly spending summaries**. The aim: to help people make smarter financial choices without the complexity of full-scale financial software.

## What Stakeholders Get
- **Clear Insights:** Weekly summary of spending by category  
- **Smarter Decisions:** Spot where money is being wasted and redirect toward savings  
- **Simple Experience:** Lightweight, private, and focused on what matters  

---

## How It Works (High Level)
1. Users upload their bank transaction data once a week  
2. The system categorizes spending into intuitive groups (food, transport, shopping, etc.)  
3. A summary report (table + chart) is generated to show patterns and highlight opportunities to save  

---

## Key Assumptions
- Users are willing to upload their transaction data weekly  
- Data remains **private and local** — no sharing with third parties  
- Insights must be **simple and visual**, not overwhelming  

---

## Risks to Watch
- Messy merchant names can make categorization difficult  
- Users may forget to upload their data  
- Weekly summaries alone may not drive long-term behavior change (future alerts/goals may be needed)  

---

## Next Step
Deliver the first working prototype of **weekly spending summaries** using sample data. This will demonstrate value and guide whether to expand features.

**Budget Lens** is about turning confusing bank statements into **actionable insights** that help everyday people save money and spend smarter.
